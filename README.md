This is my First Go program, provides content generation, and web service to deliver a static web page.

The content generation is supported by data sets. Hereby it will be easy to connect to database for furture content dynamic updating. 

Go is really a light language, ommitted several data and program structures. I installed the environment 4 days ago, started learn it from scratch 3 days ago, and got this. Seems good and quick. But its speed would be the most attractiveness on which I will explore later. 

If you have any fancy idea, please do not hesitate to let me know.
